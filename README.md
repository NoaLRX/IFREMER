## Optimizing IAM model forecasts
This repo is related to an analysis of FDI data from Mediterranean fisheries. 


These data are classified and cannot be shared.



However, a declassified part exists [on the FDI website](https://dcf.ec.europa.eu/data-calls/fdi_en?prefLang=fr).

Here, you will find only the cleaning scripts, data analysis and forecasting models. 

This analysis is based on [STECF reports](https://stecf.ec.europa.eu/documents_en?prefLang=fr), and is intended to optimize the parametrization of [Ifremer's IAM forecasting model](https://www.umr-amure.fr/modelisation-bio-economique-des-pecheries-iam/).


The aim is to make the LPUEs of "static" species *(not modelled in the IAM model)* dynamic, in order to better forecast the sales of these species.
